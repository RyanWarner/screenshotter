# web-screenshotter

This tool uses Playwright to take screenshots of a user specified URL with added query params based on some data.

Currently the primary purpose is to create open-graph images from MDX files.

## TODO

- Turn this into an NPM package
- Support JSON in addition to MDX
- Examples & tutorials for different use cases

## Credits

- [Tony](https://github.com/talves) wrote the initial working version, inspiring me and priving feedback and guidance along the way.
